##Hi I hope this helps a little...


# mevn-project
## contains three parts:

### A) first sketch of the slotmachine/gallery based on mevn-cli setup: 

code inside client and server directory 

```bash
cd mevn-project
mevn serve
```
-client (opens Index.vue)
-server (DUMMY DATA BUT STILL EMPTY)

### next steps: 
create a better prototype of the navigation and UI similar to the sketch on figma. https://www.figma.com/file/0Q6ESHakKU2ZeNoiZwX9Lb/APP-Men4


## B) CRUD Commands: made from a tutorial, working app with crud commands, created design with the plugin vueify (css framework similar to bootstrap syntax).
split terminal

```bash
cd server-2 
npm start serve

cd client-2 
npm run serve
```
### should be connected to a shared database, .


## C) slotmachine
