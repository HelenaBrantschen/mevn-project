#Hi Nick hope this helps a little...


# mevn-project
# contains three parts:

# A) first sketch of the slotmachine/gallery based on mevn-cli setup: 

# code inside client and server directory 

cd mevn-project
mevn serve
# -client (opens Index.vue)
# -server (DUMMY DATA BUT STILL EMPTY)

# next steps: create a better prototype of the navigation and UI similar to the sketch on figma.


# B) CRUD Commands: made from a tutorial, working app with crud commands, created design with the plugin vueify (css framework similar to bootstrap syntax).
# split terminal

cd server-2 
npm start serve

cd client-2 
npm run serve

# should be connected to an live database, sent you an invite per mail.
# next steps: try to adapt the app to my wishes, Should i stay with vueify or try to recreate without?

C) slotmachine
first sketch of moving posts, addapted slotmachine based on github project made with bootstrap. 

next steps: eliminate error in the displayed posts try to simplify code and delete the unnecessary parts, if to complicated delete and start from scratch.
